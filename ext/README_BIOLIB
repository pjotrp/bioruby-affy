This is a port of the Ben Bolstad's Affyio R/Bioconductor package to BIOLIB
(http://biolib.open-bio.org/)

Affyio allows raw access to Affymetrix microarray .CEL and .CDF files. This means
you can access the PM and MM signal for single probes, and you can get the 
information to combine probes into probesets.

The BioLib mapping is in the file ./src/biolib_affyio.c and see the online API
documentation at http://biolib.open-bio.org/ for more information.

One interface is provided. It maintains state through a handle.

Notes:

* while Affyio makes limited use of R libraries this first port requires Rlib to
  be available (this may change later)
* the current implementation retains a lot of unused Affy information in 
  memory - there is a case to be made to have two versions: One minimalistic - 
  giving the usual probe info and one full giving all Affy info
* the C library is not particularly safe on index ranges - i.e. you have
  to be careful not to go out of bounds

Modifications on the R source are:

- Introducing biolib_affyio.h and biolib_affyio.c in ./src
- Added ./test folder with sample CEL file(s)
- Moved CEL definition into header file read_abatch.h
- Moved CDF definition into header file read_cdf.h
- Some previously static functions exported in read_cdf.h
- stdint.h is default
